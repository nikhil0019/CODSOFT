**CodSoft Internship Projects**

This repository contains the projects I completed during my internship with **CodSoft**. Each project focuses on implementing machine learning models to solve real-world problems, ranging from predicting music genres to detecting spam messages and predicting customer churn.

**Projects**

**1. Genre Predictor**

The **Genre Predictor** project aims to classify music tracks into different genres based on various features. The dataset used contains attributes like tempo, loudness, and other acoustic features. The model helps in automatically categorizing tracks, simplifying playlist generation and music recommendation systems.

**Technologies Used**:

- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn (for visualization)

**Key Features**:

- Data Preprocessing (handling missing values, encoding)
- Feature selection and engineering
- Model training and evaluation using algorithms like Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors, and Logistic Regression.

**2. Spam Message Detector**

The **Spam Message Detector** project focuses on building a classifier to distinguish between spam and ham (non-spam) messages. This project involves natural language processing (NLP) techniques to handle the text data and classify messages accurately.

**Technologies Used**:

- Python
- Scikit-learn, NLTK
- Pandas, NumPy
- TF-IDF Vectorization
- Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes

**Key Features**:

- Text data preprocessing (tokenization, stopwords removal)
- TF-IDF feature extraction
- Model training and evaluation using classification algorithms
- High accuracy in detecting spam messages.

**3. Customer Churn Prediction**

The **Customer Churn Prediction** project uses customer data from a U.S. bank to predict whether a customer will leave the bank or not. The model leverages customer demographics and behavior patterns to identify customers at risk of churning.

**Technologies Used**:

- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas, NumPy
- Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting

**Key Features**:

- Data preprocessing (handling missing values, encoding categorical features)
- Model training, tuning, and evaluation
- Predictive insights to reduce customer churn.
